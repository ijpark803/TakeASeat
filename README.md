# TakeASeat
Project Implemented by Kaitlyn Werden, Irene Park, and Kevin Arackaparambil 

Built with Android Studio Giraffe 
Run on Google Pixel 2 Emulator 
API Version 24 (Google API Version) x86

Thank you for evaluating our project -- there are some bugs with our first implementation, but here are some tips on how to navigate our program smoothly. 

1) Press the run button in android studio using the emulator guidelines stated above.
2) Navigate to the map page located at the bottom of the screen. If you are not logged in, you will not be able to view the building info or reserve seats at this time.
3) Press the profile button or click on a marker -- you will be redirected to a login page if you are not logged in.
4) If you do not have an account press the register button.
5) Fill out the credentials -- please note you must upload a profile picture and fill in all the fields appropriately (the information is case sensitive and will be requested again if you log out and choose to log back in)
6) For uploading a profile picture choose the complete with photos option. Follow the prompts and open up the camera app and take a photo. Use that photo to upload to the registration page.
7) Now that you are logged in , feel free to navigate to the map or view your profile using the two buttons.
8) Navigate to the map view and click on a marker. This will take you to the building page.
9) Select consecutive timeslots, the app will not allow you to have gaps in your reservation or more than 4 consecutive slots.
10) Click on the respective reserve button (indoor or outdoor) on the top of the page based on which seat you would like.
11) Navigate to the profile page to see your reservation logged.

That concludes the step by step process for navigating our app. We hope you enjoyed!

-- Sincerely, Kevin, Irene & Kaitlyn
